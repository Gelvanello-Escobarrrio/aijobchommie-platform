2. **Include detailed information**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Your contact information
   - Any suggested fixes (optional)

3. **Use encryption** (optional but appreciated):
   - PGP Key: Available on request
   - Signal: Contact via email first

### What to Expect

##  Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

When contributing code, please:

- **Validate all inputs** at API boundaries
- **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
- **Sanitize outputs** to prevent XSS
- **Implement proper authentication** checks
- **Follow the principle of least privilege**
- **Keep dependencies updated**
- **Use secure coding practices**

### Example: Input Validation
```typescript
//  Good: Proper input validation
import { z } from 'zod';

const userInputSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  name: z.string().min(1).max(100),
  phone: z.string().regex(/^\+27\d{9}$/)
});

export const validateUserInput = (data: unknown) => {
  return userInputSchema.parse(data);
};
```

### Example: SQL Injection Prevention
```typescript
//  Good: Using parameterized queries
const getJobsByLocation = async (location: string) => {
  return await db.query(
    'SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE location = $1',
    [location]
  );
};

//  Bad: String concatenation
const unsafeQuery = `SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE location = '${location}'`;
```

##  Security Testing

### Automated Security Checks

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

- **Dependency vulnerability scanning** with npm audit
- **Static code analysis** with ESLint security rules
- **SAST scanning** with CodeQL
- **Container scanning** with Docker security tools
- **License compliance** checking

### Manual Security Testing

We perform:

- **Penetration testing** quarterly
- **Code security reviews** for critical changes
- **Third-party security audits** annually
- **Compliance assessments** for POPIA/GDPR

##  Security Measures in Place

### Application Security
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- Output encoding to prevent XSS
- CSRF protection with tokens
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- Secure headers (helmet.js)
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

### Infrastructure Security
- HTTPS enforcement (TLS 1.2+)
- Secure cookie configuration
- Environment variable protection
- Database connection encryption
- Redis authentication
- Container security best practices

### Monitoring & Detection
- Security event logging
- Anomaly detection
- Failed login attempt monitoring
- Suspicious activity alerts
- Performance monitoring for DDoS detection
