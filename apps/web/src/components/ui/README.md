Design system: MetallicComponents

This folder contains minimal, production-ready React components used across the web app.

Components:
- MetallicButton: accessible, variant-driven button
- MetallicInput: labeled input with aria support
- MetallicCard: subtle glassmorphism card
- MetallicBadge: small badge/sticker component
- MetallicProgress: animated progress bar

Extend these components rather than replacing them to keep consistent styles.
